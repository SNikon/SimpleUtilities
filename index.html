<p>This project contains code snippets and modules for small utilities that can be used in environments that have limited resources. This is not intended to be a professional library that competes with other frameworks for development, but it may come in handy in particular situations where libraries such as jQuery or Angular must be avoided but to company constraints, restrictive environments, or developing on top of problematic implementations of ECMAScript.</p>

<p>This is a work-in-progress, extending as I see the need to add new features for my own use, and I am sure that there will be much better implementations to everything that I can possibly write, as I do not have the time or resources to evolve this into a mature library. I will try commenting everything and keep the code as clean as I can, and feel free to judge the code for yourselves, comment on it, or help with this library! </p>

<a id="module-summary-wip" class="anchor" href="#module-summary-wip" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Module Summary (WIP)</h2>

<h3>
<a id="debug" class="anchor" href="#debug" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Debug</h3>

<p>Small module to handle logging information. Provides the means to turn logging on and off at any time and allows attaching to a DOM element to write directly into it, for visual feedback where a console is not available.</p>

<h3>
<a id="dom" class="anchor" href="#dom" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dom</h3>

<p><strong><em>TODO</em></strong> Domain manipulation. At this time this module is only used to get computed styles.</p>

<h3>
<a id="google_analytics" class="anchor" href="#google_analytics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Google_Analytics</h3>

<p><strong><em>TODO</em></strong> Sets up google analytics bindings and allow for quick methods to track what you need in the manner that you need. This module is in queue to be finished.</p>

<h3>
<a id="obj_iterator" class="anchor" href="#obj_iterator" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Obj_Iterator</h3>

<p>Single purpose module, allows safe iteration through objects and allows adding a condition to iterate if necessary. This module will be merged into a larger module with more object manipulation.</p>

<h3>
<a id="scroll" class="anchor" href="#scroll" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scroll</h3>

<p>Allows manipulating the scrolling of a div using ECMAScript. I will extend this to allow for fully circular scrolling and most likely automated one.</p>

<h3>
<a id="string" class="anchor" href="#string" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>String</h3>

<p>String manipulation. Allows serializing an object into several forms such as form-data, query string and JSON string. Yes, one would assume that window.JSON exists everywhere for stringification but that is not true unfortunately.
Also contains '.format' method that acts like the amazing C# String.Format, a slightly different syntax that of the marvelous printf in C and C++.</p>

<h3>
<a id="template" class="anchor" href="#template" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Template</h3>

<p>An absolutely unnecessary module if you use RequireJS, which allows for loading and caching HTML templates. You can find the alternative to this in the project Tech-Experiments in <a href="https://github.com/SNikon" class="user-mention">@SNikon</a> that uses RequireJS and the require-text plugin that will potentially suit your needs much better.</p>

<h3>
<a id="xhr" class="anchor" href="#xhr" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Xhr</h3>

<p>A module that is absolutely necessary for me but probably irrelevant to you. Allows similar functionalities to jQuery's ajax calls, and also allows adding events after the request has already being sent and possibly received. The module returns an object containing the information to be submitted and, if concluded, the information received. This module makes no promise that if you insert a "complete" event before a "success" or "error" event, that it will be triggered in that order.</p>

<h2>
<a id="reference" class="anchor" href="#reference" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reference</h2>

<p>TODO, sorry. The modules very small at this point, I doubt anyone will need a reference lookup, not even myself.</p>

<h2>
<a id="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h2>

<p>This page was made using the GitHub page generator. I will make a proper one for kicks and giggles once I find the time.</p>

<p>This project, much like others that I own, are knowledge repositories in case I need to remind myself how to do something. I have been working in too many languages and frameworks; I often forget and have to look everything up again and by keeping these repositories I have the knowledge applied and therefore it is easier to remember; Or I just come here to remind myself how to do.</p>
